ATButtonsToolbar is component which creates [[ATButton]]'s on it, this looks like toolbar.

It don't support creating toolbar in IDE design time.
You need to call methods:

* AddButton: to add usual button, specify here ImageIndex, Caption (caption won't show), Hint, OnClick
* AddDropdown: to add button which looks like arrow-down, specify here PopupMenu, menu will show on click
* AddSep: to add button which is disabled and looks like "|" separator line
* UpdateControls: this makes items placement, you must call it after changes (also after ImageList size is changed)

* Use props ButtonCount and Buttons[i] to get ATButton's from component.
* Use Buttons[i].Free to delete buttons.
* To make vertical toolbar, set prop KindVertucal to True. In the vertical mode, don't add buttons of kind "dropdown arrow only", they won't paint ok, and it makes no sence.
